      <h1>About RDroid Apps</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>RDroid Apps</strong> is an independent software project focused on building
        simple, useful, and privacy-respecting applications across multiple platforms.
        The project is primarily developed and maintained by a developer, with ideas,
        feedback, and suggestions coming from friends, collaborators, and modern
        development tools.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Cross-Platform Vision</h2>

      <p>
        The goal of RDroid Apps is to create practical software that works reliably

        naturally expanded to include Windows tools that complement mobile workflows.
        Whether on a phone or a desktop, RDroid Apps aims to provide clear, focused,
        and easy-to-use solutions for everyday digital tasks.
      </p>
